This configuration is used on my household wifi which was simple to setup when I used the professors tutorial. I set it up using the GUI interface, but below are the files the professor asked for.
I didn’t run into any problems, thankfully.

Here is my /etc/network/interfaces file:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp

Here is my /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
	ssid="Home"
	psk=“blahblahblah”
	proto=RSN
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	pairwise=TKIP
	auth_alg=OPEN
}

I intentionally changed my password in this text file (psk=“blahblahblah”) so people can’t come over and steal my bandwidth haha!
